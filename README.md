# Student Score Prediction:
A machine learning project to predict student exam scores based on various academic and personal factors.

## Project Overview:
This project analyzes student performance data and builds predictive models to forecast exam scores based on factors such as:
- Hours studied
- Attendance
- Parental involvement
- Access to resources
- Previous scores
- And many other features
  
The primary goal is to identify the most influential factors affecting student performance and develop an accurate model that can be used to predict future scores. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal, including both simple and more complex models to compare their performance.

## Dataset:
-The dataset `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`.
-It contains 6,607 records with 20 features including both numerical and categorical variables.
-The features capture a wide range of academic, social, and personal attributes that could potentially influence a student's score.

## Workflow:
The process involves:
-Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
-Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
-Handling missing values and outliers.
-Training multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.

## Tools & Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
-Python
-Pandas – For data handling and manipulation.
-NumPy – For numerical operations.
-Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization.
-Scikit-learn – For modeling, preprocessing, and evaluation.
